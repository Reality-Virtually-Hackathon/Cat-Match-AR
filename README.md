# Cat-Match-AR0

Cat Match AR is an idle game with 5 inputs: pet, feed, play, swap cat to left, and swap cat to right. The player is timed while they interact with a variety of adorable animated cats in the comfort of their own homes through Augmented Reality by petting the kitties, giving the kitties treats and playing with the kitties. Depending on the cat's profile, each kitty's approval meter will fill or empty accordingly to how much they enjoy the activity. Player's can visit with multiple kitties to find the kitty that they get along with the best. At the end of their time, the player is given their "purrfect match" and their stats so they can see what kind of interactions the player prefers. This is to help them understand their kitty preferences for actual adoption.
